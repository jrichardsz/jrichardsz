Hi, I'm JRichardsz
=====================================================================================================================================

FullStack Architect & Developer, Linux and sci-fi fan
----------------------------------

I am a software developer with more than thirteen years of experience on writing almost all types of software (web, desktop, mobile, daemon, cli, devops) in all the stages (plan, design, develop, build, release, test, deploy, monitoring) and with a hint of artificial intelligence. 

I have an unwavering passion about everything I do, and I give the most of my energy to achieve my goals.

Currently working as Software Architect ( > 8 years)

About the human...

- I work-out almost every day. 
- I like creativity and develop new things. 
- I have an insatiable hunger for knowledge all the time and at the same time the imperative need to document and share it. Stackoverflow seems a good place to do that :D
- I love movies, series, books, mangas, animes and everything related to sci-fi
